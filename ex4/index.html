          <h3><strong>Looking for a unique gift?</strong></h3>
          <p>
            Town Hall has the answer. For only $100, you can get a book of tickets for all of the remaining speakers.
            And the bargain includes a second book of tickets for a companion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or, for $50, you can give yourself the gift of our speakers, and still get an extra ticket for a companion,
            but for just one of the events.
          </p>
          <p>See you at the next show?</p>
